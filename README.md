## üìö Development Journal: What Was Tried & Why It Didn't Always Work

### **Phase 1: Monolithic Approach (Initial Attempt)**
**What We Built:**
- Single Python service handling all protocols
- Shared event parsing logic across CoW Swap, Relay, Portals
- Unified database schema for all affiliate transactions

**Why It Failed:**
- **Brittle Architecture**: One protocol failure would crash the entire system
- **Debugging Nightmare**: Impossible to isolate issues between protocols
- **Memory Issues**: Large block scans would consume excessive RAM
- **Single Point of Failure**: RPC rate limits would block all protocols simultaneously

**Specific Problems:**
```
Error: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'
Cause: Web3.py compatibility issues when parsing different event formats
Impact: Complete system failure, lost transactions
```

### **Phase 2: Modular Repository (Intermediate Solution)**
**What We Built:**
- Separate directories per protocol with shared utilities
- Common ABI parsing and event detection
- Shared CSV storage and block tracking

**Why It Still Had Issues:**
- **Shared Dependencies**: Version conflicts between protocol requirements
- **Coupled Deployments**: Couldn't update one protocol without affecting others
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple protocols competing for RPC connections
- **Complex Error Handling**: Shared error handling made debugging difficult

**Specific Problems:**
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded on Infura
Cause: Multiple protocols hitting RPC endpoints simultaneously
Impact: Missed blocks, incomplete transaction data
```

### **Phase 3: Standalone Services (Current Working Solution)**
**What We Built:**
- Independent services for each protocol
- Protocol-specific configurations and error handling
- Separate deployment and scaling capabilities

**Why This Works Better:**
- **Isolated Failures**: One protocol can fail without affecting others
- **Independent Scaling**: Each protocol can be scaled based on its needs
- **Easier Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific protocols
- **Flexible Deployment**: Can update protocols independently

### **Protocol-Specific Challenges & Solutions**

#### **CoW Swap - The Success Story**
**Initial Problems:**
- Complex event structure with nested affiliate data
- Multiple affiliate addresses across different chains
- High transaction volume requiring efficient filtering

**Solutions That Worked:**
- Custom ABI parsing for affiliate fee events
- Chain-specific affiliate address filtering
- Block chunking to handle high volume
- Persistent CSV-based block tracking

**Why It Succeeded:**
- Well-documented event structure
- Consistent affiliate fee emission patterns
- Active development community with clear examples

#### **Relay - The Persistent Challenge**
**Initial Problems:**
- `'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'` errors
- Inconsistent event emission patterns
- Complex cross-chain fee routing

**What We Tried:**
1. **Standard Web3.py parsing** ‚Üí Failed with bytes encoding errors
2. **Custom event decoder** ‚Üí Worked but was fragile
3. **Multiple ABI versions** ‚Üí Inconsistent results
4. **Event signature filtering** ‚Üí Missed some transactions

**Why It's Still Challenging:**
- Web3.py compatibility issues with specific event formats
- Events emitted differently across chains (Ethereum vs Base)
- Complex fee routing logic that's hard to track

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Working**: Basic event detection and parsing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues**: Occasional parsing errors, missed transactions
- üîß **Next Steps**: Implement more robust error handling

#### **Portals - The Lucky One**
**Why It Works Well:**
- Leverages CoW Swap's proven listener design
- Consistent event structure
- Lower transaction volume

**What We Learned:**
- Reusing working patterns is more effective than reinventing
- Protocol integration can simplify monitoring
- Shared infrastructure reduces maintenance overhead

#### **ButterSwap - The Quiet One**
**Initial Problems:**
- No affiliate activity detected
- clear that the protocol is actually generating fees--we just can't see them on-chain
- Base chain RPC limitations

**What We Tried:**
1. **Direct contract monitoring** ‚Üí No events found
2. **Transaction scanning** ‚Üí No affiliate patterns detected
3. **Community research** ‚Üí Limited documentation available

**Current Understanding:**
- Protocol may not be flagging fees in any on-chain/public way.
- Listener is operational but monitoring for future activity
- May need to investigate how affiliate partners are tracked

### **Technical Challenges That Persisted**

#### **1. Event Log Parsing Issues**
**Problem:**
```
'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'
TypeError: Object of type AttributeDict is not JSON serializable
```

**Root Causes:**
- Web3.py version compatibility issues
- Different blockchain clients emit events differently
- Protocol-specific event structures

**Solutions Tried:**
- **Explicit type conversion** ‚Üí Worked for some cases
- **Custom JSON encoders** ‚Üí Complex and error-prone
- **Event filtering** ‚Üí Reduced errors but missed transactions
- **Multiple parsing strategies** ‚Üí Increased complexity

#### **2. RPC Provider Limitations**
**Problem:**
- Free-tier rate limits (Infura: 100k requests/day, Alchemy: 300M compute units/month)
- Large block scans would exceed limits
- Provider outages would stop all monitoring

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Provider rotation** ‚Üí Reduced single point of failure
- **Block chunking** ‚Üí Stayed within rate limits
- **Retry backoff** ‚Üí Handled temporary failures
- **Fallback providers** ‚Üí Maintained uptime

**Why It Still Causes Issues:**
- Rate limits are still hit during high-volume periods
- Provider rotation adds complexity
- Some chains have limited RPC options

#### **3. Cross-Chain Consistency**
**Problem:**
